And what may happen to us?Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, Sapiens integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas.Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become?Featuring 27 photographs, 6 maps, and 25 illustrations/diagrams, this provocative and insightful work is sure to spark debate and is essential reading for aficionados of Jared Diamond, James Gleick, Matt Ridley, Robert Wright, and Sharon Moalem. ...more'}, {'titulo': 'Unbound: How Eight Technologies Made Us Human, Transformed Society, and Brought Our World to the Brink', 'descripción': 'Although we usually think of technology as something unique to modern times, our ancestors began to create the first technologies millions of years ago in the form of prehistoric tools and weapons.

Over time, eight key technologies gradually freed us from the limitations of our animal origins.The fabrication of weapons, the mastery of fire, and the technologies of clothing and shelter radically restructured the human body, enabling us to walk upright, shed our body hair, and migrate out of tropical Africa. Symbolic communication transformed human evolution from a slow biological process into a fast cultural process. The invention of agriculture revolutionized the relationship between humanity and the environment, and the technologies of interaction led to the birth of civilization. Precision machinery spawned the industrial revolution and the rise of nation-states; and in the next metamorphosis, digital technologies may well unite all of humanity for the benefit of future generations.Synthesizing the findings of primatology, paleontology, archeology, history, and anthropology, Richard Currier reinterprets and retells the modern narrative of human evolution that began with the discovery of Lucy and other Australopithecus fossils. But the same forces that allowed us to integrate technology into every aspect of our daily lives have also brought us to the brink of planetary catastrophe.

It was a time of creativity unparalleled in history before or since, from science to the arts, from philosophy to politics. Acclaimed philosopher and historian A.C. Grayling points to three primary factors that led to the rise of vernacular (popular) languages in philosophy, theology, science, and literature; the rise of the individual as a general and not merely an aristocratic type; and the invention and application of instruments and measurement in the study of the natural world.Grayling vividly reconstructs this unprecedented era and breathes new life into the major figures of the seventeenth century intelligentsia who span literature, music, science, art, and philosophy--Shakespeare, Monteverdi, Galileo, Rembrandt, Locke, Newton, Descartes, Vermeer, Hobbes, Milton, and Cervantes, among many more. During this century, a fundamentally new way of perceiving the world emerged as reason rose to prominence over tradition, and the rights of the individual took center stage in philosophy and politics, a paradigmatic shift that would define Western thought for centuries to come. ...more'}, {'titulo': 'Political Suicide: Missteps, Peccadilloes, Bad Calls, Backroom Hijinx, Sordid Pasts, Rotten Breaks, and Just Plain Dumb Mistakes in the Annals of American Politics', 'descripción': \"Just in time for the presidential election of 2016 comes Political Suicide, a history of the best and most interesting missteps, peccadilloes, bad calls, back room hijinks, sordid pasts, rotten breaks, and just plain dumb mistakes in the annals of American politics.They have tweeted their private parts to women they're trying to impress.

Like their acclaimed bestseller George Washington's Secret Six, Thomas Jefferson and the Tripoli Pirates sheds new light on a vitally important episode that has been forgotten by most Americans. Â\\xa0 Only weeks after President Jefferson's inauguration in 1801, he decided to confront the Tripoli pirates who had been kidnapping American ships and sailors, among other outrageous acts. Though inclined toward diplomacy, Jefferson sent warships to blockade Tripoli and protect American shipping, and then escalated to all-out war against the Barbary states. Â\\xa0 The tiny American flotillaâ\\x80\\x94with three frigates representing half of the U.S. Navyâ\\x80\\x99s top-of-the-line shipsâ\\x80\\x94had some success in blockading the Barbary coast. But that success came to an end when the USSÂ\\xa0PhiladelphiaÂ\\xa0ran aground in Tripoli harbor and was captured. Kilmeade and Yaeger recount the dramatic story of a young American sailor, Stephen Decatur, who snuck into the harbor, boarded theÂ\\xa0Philadelphia,Â\\xa0and set her on fire before escaping amid a torrent of enemy gunfire. Â\\xa0 Another amazing story is that of William Eatonâ\\x80\\x99s daring attack on the port city of Derna. He led a detachment of Marines on a 500-mile trek across the desert to surprise the port. His strategy worked, and an American flag was raised in victory on foreign soil for the first time.

Scores of Jewish prophets, preachers, and would-be messiahs wandered through the Holy Land, bearing messages from God. This was the age of zealotryâ\\x80\\x94a fervent nationalism that made resistance to the Roman occupation a sacred duty incumbent on all Jews. And few figures better exemplified this principle than the charismatic Galilean who defied both the imperial authorities and their allies in the Jewish religious hierarchy.Balancing the Jesus of the Gospels against the historical sources, Aslan describes a man full of conviction and passion, yet rife with contradiction; a man of peace who exhorted his followers to arm themselves with swords; an exorcist and faith healer who urged his disciples to keep his identity a secret; and ultimately the seditious â\\x80\\x9cKing of the Jewsâ\\x80\\x9d whose promise of liberation from Rome went unfulfilled in his brief lifetime. Aslan explores the reasons why the early Christian church preferred to promulgate an image of Jesus as a peaceful spiritual teacher rather than a politically conscious revolutionary. And he grapples with the riddle of how Jesus understood himself, the mystery that is at the heart of all subsequent claims about his divinity.Zealot yields a fresh perspective on one of the greatest stories ever told even as it affirms the radical and transformative nature of Jesus of Nazarethâ\\x80\\x99s life and mission. The result is a thought-provoking, elegantly written biography with the pulse of a fast-paced novel: a singularly brilliant portrait of a man, a time, and the birth of a religion. ...more'}, {'titulo': 'A Distant Mirror: The Calamitous 14th Century', 'descripción': 'Barbara W.

Beginning with \"Boston Light,\"Â\\xa0Americaâ\\x80\\x99s first lighthouse, Dolin shows how the story of America, from colony to regional backwater, toÂ\\xa0fledging nation, and eventually to global industrial power, can be illustrated through its lighthouses.Even in the colonial era, the question of how best to solve the collective problem of lighting our ports, reefs, and coasts through a patchwork of private interests and independent localities telegraphed the great American debate over federalism and the role of a centralized government. As the nation expanded, throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, so too did the coastlines in need of illumination, from New England to the Gulf of Mexico, the Great Lakes, the Pacific Coast all the way to Alaska. In Dolin\\'s hands we see how each of these beacons tell itsÂ\\xa0own story of political squabbling, technological advancement, engineering marvel, and individual derring-do.In rollicking detail, Dolin treats readers to a memorable cast of characters, from the penny-pinching Treasury official Stephen Pleasonton, who hamstrung the country\\'s efforts to adopt the revolutionary Fresnel lens, to the indomitableÂ\\xa0Katherine Walker, who presided so heroically over New York HarborÂ\\xa0as keeper at Robbins Reef LighthouseÂ\\xa0that she was hailed as a genuine New York City folk hero upon her death in 1931.

Challenging the widely prevalent belief that Jefferson remains so opaque as to be unknowable, the authorsâ\\x80\\x94through their careful analysis, painstaking research, and vivid proseâ\\x80\\x94create a portrait of Jefferson, as he might have painted himself, one \"comprised of equal parts sun and shadow\" (Jane Kamensky).Tracing Jefferson\\'s philosophical development from youth to old age, the authors explore what they call the \"empire\" of Jefferson\\'s imaginationâ\\x80\\x94an expansive state of mind born of his origins in a slave society, his intellectual influences, and the vaulting ambition that propelled him into public life as a modern avatar of the Enlightenment who, at the same time, likened himself to a figure of oldâ\\x80\\x94\"the most blessed of the patriarchs.\" Indeed, Jefferson saw himself as a \"patriarch,\" not just to his country and mountain-like home at Monticello but also to his family, the white half that he loved so publicly, as well as to the black side that he claimed to love, a contradiction of extraordinary historical magnitude.Divided into three sections, \"Most Blessed of the Patriarchs\" reveals a striking personal dimension to his life. Part I,Â\\xa0\"Patriarch,\" explores Jeffersons\\'s origins in Virgina; Part II, \" \\'Traveller,\\' \" covers his five-year sojourn to Paris; and Part III, \"Enthusiast,\" delves insightfully into the Virginian\\'s views on Christianity, slavery, and race.

Others fought to survive torpedo explosions, flaming oil slicks, storms, shark attacks, mine blasts, and harrowing lifeboat odysseysâ\\x80\\x94only to ship out again on the next boat as soon as they'd returned to safety.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 The Mathews Men shows us the war far beyond traditional battlefieldsâ\\x80\\x94often the U.S. merchant marinersâ\\x80\\x99 life-and-death struggles took place just off the U.S. coastâ\\x80\\x94but also takes us to the landing beaches at D-Day and to the Pacific. â\\x80\\x9cWhen final victory is ours,â\\x80\\x9d General Dwight D.

For the first fifty years of her life nothing at all out of the ordinary had ever happened to her. She was an old-maid watchmaker living contentedly with her spinster sister and their elderly father in the tiny Dutch house over their shop. Their uneventful days, as regulated as their own watches, revolved around their abiding love for one another. However, with the Nazi invasion and occupation of Holland, a story did ensue. Corrie ten Boom and her family became leaders in the Dutch Underground, hiding Jewish people in their home in a specially built room and aiding their escape from the Nazis. For their help, all but Corrie found death in a concentration camp.

Bacevich provides a searing reassessment of U.S. military policy in the Middle East over the past four decades. From the end of World War II until 1980, virtually no American soldiers were killed in action while serving in the Greater Middle East. Since 1990, virtually no American soldiers have been killed in action anywhere else. What caused this shift? Andrew J. Bacevich, one of the countryâ\\x80\\x99s most respected voices on foreign affairs, offers an incisive critical history of this ongoing military enterpriseâ\\x80\\x94now more than thirty years old and with no end in sight. During the 1980s, Bacevich argues, a great transition occurred. As the Cold War wound down, the United States initiated a new conflictâ\\x80\\x94a War for the Greater Middle Eastâ\\x80\\x94that continues to the present day. The long twilight struggle with the Soviet Union had involved only occasional and sporadic fighting. But as this new war unfolded, hostilities became persistent. From the Balkans and East Africa to the Persian Gulf and Central Asia, U.S. forces embarked upon a seemingly endless series of campaigns across the Islamic world. Few achieved anything remotely like conclusive success. Instead, actions undertaken with expectations of promoting peace and stability produced just the opposite. As a consequence, phrases like â\\x80\\x9cpermanent warâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9copen-ended warâ\\x80\\x9d have become part of everyday discourse. Connecting the dots in a way no other historian has done before, Bacevich weaves a compelling narrative out of episodes as varied as the Beirut bombing of 1983, the Mogadishu firefight of 1993, the invasion of Iraq in 2003, and the rise of ISIS in the present decade. Understanding what Americaâ\\x80\\x99s costly military exertions have wrought requires seeing these seemingly discrete events as parts of a single war. It also requires identifying the errors of judgment made by political leaders in both parties and by senior military officers who share responsibility for what has become a monumental march to folly. This Bacevich unflinchingly does. A twenty-year army veteran who served in Vietnam, Andrew J. Bacevich brings the full weight of his expertise to this vitally important subject. Americaâ\\x80\\x99s War for the Greater Middle East is a bracing after-action report from the front lines of history. It will fundamentally change the way we view Americaâ\\x80\\x99s engagement in the worldâ\\x80\\x99s most volatile region.Advance praise for Americaâ\\x80\\x99s War for the Greater Middle Eastâ\\x80\\x9cIn one arresting book after another, Bacevich has relentlessly laid bare the failings of American foreign policy since the Cold War. This one is his sad crowning achievement: the story of our long and growing military entanglement in the region of the most tragic, bitter, and intractable of conflicts.â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94Richard K.
