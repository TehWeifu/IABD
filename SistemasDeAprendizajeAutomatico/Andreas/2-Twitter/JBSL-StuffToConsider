Tweets
    - Timezone: gives warning when loading the dataset, useless because all the same
    - place: very few entries, data doesnt seem relevant, useless
    - Created_at: timestamp of the tweet, not useful because we also have the datetime
    - cashtags: most null values, don't know what it means, useless
    - user_id, user_id_str, username, name: all the same, choose one to join the other entity
    - day, hour: already in the datetime, useless
    - link: not relevant, useless
    - search: only null values, useless
    - near: only null values, useless
    - geo: only null values, useless
    - source: only null values, useless
    - translate: only null values, useless
    - trans_src: only null values, useless
    - trans_dest: only null values, useless


TODO:
    - Filter out retweets? Maybe give some 'plus' to the original tweet?
    - Check difference between id and conversation_id
    - Language: check if it is useful, most are english. Split just between english and non-english tweets
    - From the datetime check the day of the week, hour. Why were these variables duplicated in the dataset?
    - urls, photos, video: check if they are useful, maybe combine them as media?
    - thumbnail: doesn't seem useful, maybe combine with media
    - Quote: check if it is useful, maybe combine with media
