Tweets
    - Timezone: gives warning when loading the dataset, useless because all the same
    - place: very few entries, data doesn't seem relevant, useless
    - Created_at: timestamp of the tweet, not useful because we also have the datetime
    - cashtags: most null values, don't know what it means, useless
    - user_id, user_id_str, username, name: all the same, choose one to join the other entity
    - day, hour: already in the datetime, BUT IMPORTANT
    - link: not relevant, useless
    - search: only null values, useless
    - near: only null values, useless
    - geo: only null values, useless
    - source: only null values, useless
    - translate: only null values, useless
    - trans_src: only null values, useless
    - trans_dest: only null values, useless


TODO:
    - Tweet: content, can be useful for NLP but otherwise...?
    - Should we consider the tweets written during weekends? Ppl usually don't work on weekends...
    - Let's say the model gives you certian tweets with their probability to be popular, so a journalist can pick the tweet easier.
        - The risk of missing a viral tweet is higher than the risk of picking a non-viral tweet (just some money lost for the wage of the journalist)
        - My threshhold is going to be realitiably low, why? so there can be a wider pool to chose from. I want to be a bit permissive so i lower the threshold
    
Retweets
    - Could be an interesting variable, but not sure if legit to use it
    - If a retweet is made almost instantly, it could mean a collab

Target
    - 1 person takes 1 hour to write an article. Can't be much more because you will lose the trend.
    - 1 person writes 40 articles in a week, the dataset time range.
    - The company has 50? employees, so 2000 articles in a week. Copium.
    - The target should be consistent in the quantile that leaves us with more than 2000 articles in a week.

Id vs conversation id
    - They are replies, interation is the half of original tweets. delete them?
    - Maybe make 2 models and compare them

language
    - Most of the tweets are in english
    - Non-english tweets have overall more interactions
    - Other languages are very little represented
    - Korean tweets are giga-inflated. Los chichos >>>>>> BTS

Quote_url:
    - Tells if the tweet is a quote of another tweet
    - Quotes tweets have slightly more interactions
    - Probably not worth it considered how little represented they are

Media:
    - Tweets with some kind of media, either photos, videos o urls, have more interactions
