Tweets
    - id, name, username: keep one to join with tweets, otherwise useless
    - bio: probably hard to get anything useful from this, useless
    - join_datetime, join_date, join_time: keep one of them
    - url: useless
    - location: useless
    - followers: IMPORTANT
    - tweets, following, likes, media: might hint how active the user is but seems kinda useless
    - private: useless
    - verified: maybe give it a try but seems useless
    - avatar: useless
    - background_image: useless


TODO:
    - It seems to be a few rows with extra long id and no other data. Why? Deleted accounts?
    - Number of tweets since the time joined? Less tweets = more important? Interaction / tweet ratio?
