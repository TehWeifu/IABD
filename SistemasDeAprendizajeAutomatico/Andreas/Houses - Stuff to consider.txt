Houses - Stuff to consider

TODO:
 - Better check if duplicated entries??
 - Functional is important?


- 'Exterior1st' and 'Exterior2nd' have the same values for the most part


Columns:
  - MSZoning: most of the columns have the value 'RL'
  - LotArea: have huge standard deviation
  - Street: has 2 possible values and 1 of them only occurs a few times
  - Alley: Most of them are null
  - LotShape: Most of them are between 2 values out of 4 (group all irregulars together?)
  - LandContour: Most of them have the same value
  - Utilities: All but one have the same
  - LotConfig: Most of them have the same value (group the rest of them?)
  - LandSlope: Most of them are the same value
  - Condition1: Most of them are the same value (group ?)
  - Condition2: Most of them are the same value
  - BldgType: Most of them are the same value (group?)
  - HouseStyle: 2 values have the most of the occurrences (group?)
  - OverallQual: seems important!
