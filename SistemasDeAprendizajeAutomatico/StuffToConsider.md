Stuff to consider

- normalization and standardization
- Dimensionality reduction
- Cross validation (k-fold, leave-one-out, repeated k-fold, bootstraping)
- Regularization (L1, L2)
- Metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC, AUC, confusion matrix)
- Choose and fix a threshold
- Model selection (logistic regression, kNN, SVM, decision trees, random forest)
- Grid search for random forest


Less relevant
- Make a feature have a normal distribution
